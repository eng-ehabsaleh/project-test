                All nations of the world depend on fossil fuels for their energy
                needs. However the obligation to reduce CO2 and other gaseous
                emissions in order to be in conformity with the Kyoto agreement
                is the reason behind which countries turn to non-polluting
                renewable energy sources. In this paper the pollution caused by
                the burning of fossil fuels is initially presented followed by a
                study on the environmental protection offered by the two most
                widely used renewable energy systems, i.e. solar water heating
                and solar space heating. The results presented in this paper
                show that by using solar energy, considerable amounts of
                greenhouse polluting gasses are avoided. For the case of a
                domestic water heating system, the saving, compared to a
                conventional system, is about 80% with electricity or Diesel
                backup and is about 75% with both electricity and Diesel backup.
                In the case of space heating and hot water system the saving is
                about 40%. It should be noted, however, that in the latter, much
                greater quantities of pollutant gasses are avoided.
                Additionally, all systems investigated give positive and very
                promising financial characteristics. With respect to life cycle
                assessment of the systems, the energy spent for manufacture and
                installation of the solar systems is recouped in about 1.2
                years, whereas the payback time with respect to emissions
                produced from the embodied energy required for the manufacture
                and installation of the systems varies from a few months to 9.5
                years according to the fuel and the particular pollutant
                considered. Moreover, due to the higher solar contribution,
                solar water heating systems have much shorter payback times than
                solar space heating systems. It can, therefore, be concluded
                that solar energy systems offer significant protection to the
                environment and should be employed whenever possible in order to
                achieve a sustainable future.

            <p>Solar panels are those devices which are used to absorb
              the sun's rays and convert them into electricity 
              Description: A solar panel_ is actually a collection of solar cells,
              which can be used to generate electricity through 
              photovoltaic_ effect. These cells are arranged in a grid-like pattern
              on the surface of solar panels.</p>

        <p> energy generation project under the name of Shams Al-Hashimiah, which produces electrical energy with a capacity of 5 megawatts and at a cost of 5.6 million dinars. It contributed to reducing the university’s annual energy bill from 2.5 million dinars to zero, as the university recovered the cost of the project within a year and six months. The project covers double the university's need of electricity and meets the university's requirements and expansion, including for the next 25 years. The project was inaugurated with a ceremony attended by Prince El Hassan bin Talal .  </p>

            A solar inverter or PV inverter, is a type of electrical converter which converts the variable direct current (DC) output of a photovoltaic (PV) solar panel into a utility frequency alternating current (AC) that can be fed into a commercial electrical grid or used by a local, off-grid electrical network. It is a critical balance of system (BOS)–component in a photovoltaic system, allowing the use of ordinary AC-powered equipment. Solar power inverters have special functions adapted for use with photovoltaic arrays, including maximum power point tracking and anti-islanding protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternating current (AC) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time in contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electrical energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions, fans and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations AC and DC are often used to mean simply alternating and direct, as when they modify current or voltage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Direct current (DC) is one-directional flow of electric charge. An electrochemical cell is a prime example of DC power. Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC). A term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current.
          </p>
          <p>
            A stand-alone power system (SAPS or SPS), also known as remote area power supply (RAPS), is an off-the-grid electricity system for locations that are not fitted with an electricity distribution system. Typical SAPS include one or more methods of electricity generation, energy storage, and regulation.
            Storage is typically implemented as a battery bank, but other solutions exist including fuel cells. Power drawn directly from the battery will be direct current extra-low voltage (DC ELV), and this is used especially for lighting as well as for DC appliances. An inverter is used to generate AC low voltage, which more typical appliances can be used with.A typical stand-alone solar PV system at a sewage treatment plant in Santuari de Lluc, SpainStand-alone photovoltaic power systems are independent of the utility grid and may use solar panels only or may be used in conjunction with a diesel generator, a wind turbine or batteries.
          </p>
          <p>
            A grid-connected photovoltaic system, or grid-connected PV system is an electricity generating solar PV power system that is connected to the utility grid. A grid-connected PV system consists of solar panels, one or several inverters, a power conditioning unit and grid connection equipment. They range from small residential and commercial rooftop systems to large utility-scale solar power stations. Unlike stand-alone power systems, a grid-connected system rarely includes an integrated battery solution, as they are still very expensive. When conditions are right, the grid-connected PV system supplies the excess power, beyond consumption by the connected load, to the utility grid.
